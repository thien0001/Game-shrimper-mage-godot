 #Shrimper Mage
 
## Engines Used
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) as the game engine.
* [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for graphics.
* [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone) for sound effects.
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and PO-20 for music.

## Setting Up the Project In Place
1. Make sure you have [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/download/3.x) installed, as that is the engine version used for this game. There is no need to download the .NET version of Godot, as this project only uses GDScript.
2. Clone this repository into your desired directory: `git clone https://github.com/thien0001/Game-shrimper-mage-godot
3. Start Godot. In the initial Project Manager window, click Import and select the `project.godot` file in the root of your cloned repository.
4. Once the engine opens the project, you can run the game using the Play buttons in the upper right corner.


Ideas & Contributions
- **Testing new mechanics**: Bringing Anoma‚Äôs **intents** concept into a game environment.
- **Exploring the value of intent**: Going beyond gameplay, it also opens up a model of **non-traditional value exchange** (e.g. attention, commitment, action).
- **Community engagement**: Engaging Web2 players to experience Web3 through an accessible form ‚Äì gaming.
- **Contribution to Anoma**: Providing a real-world case study where intent is not only technical but also **experienced directly**.

## üïπÔ∏è Basic gameplay
- Players choose a mage character.
- Use **intents** to overcome challenges and unlock new levels.
- Each action is not just ‚Äúcontrol input‚Äù but also a **message of intent** that is recorded.
